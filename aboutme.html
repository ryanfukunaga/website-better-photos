            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <section id="intro">
                <p>Aloha, I'm Ryan Fukunaga, a third-year mechanical engineering student at UCLA, and I'm originally from Oahu, Hawaii. My passion for engineering is driven by my interests in both the automotive and aerospace industries. I enjoy designing and manufacturing innovative ideas.</p>

            <section id="experience">
                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>At UCLA, I am an active member of Bruin Racing Supermileage and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Being part of these clubs has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in designing, building, and testing complex engineering projects. While these experiences have taught me many technical skills, I also learned the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, and perseverance. In Bruin Racing, I work alongside a team to design the structure and power systems of our race car. Meanwhile, in UAS I design and test the winch system and motor mounts for our innovative drone. Both of these roles have allowed me to practice my technical skills and have taught me about the applications of mechanical engineering.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This past summer, I was an engineering intern at Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transit (HART). This internship allowed me to use my MATLAB skills to create a sound simulation in order to assess the amount of noise that would be created by the rail transit system. In addition to that, I got to do field work such as train clearance testing and train station assessments.</p>
                <br>
                <p> Through my engineering classes and clubs at UCLA, I've been able to gain skills with using Solidworks, MATLAB, C++, Ansys, Manufacturing (CNC/CAM), Arduino, and electronics. By making this website, I taught myself HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>
                <p>Outside of my academic activities, I am constantly seeking new challenges through designing personal projects that make my life more convenient at home. Additionally I am also apart of the wrestling club at UCLA and Grace On Campus, a christian fellowship at UCLA. In my free time, you can find me running around the neighborhood or exploring new places.</p>
